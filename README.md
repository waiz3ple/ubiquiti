   ```
   The application will be running at `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## Usage

Once the development server is running, you can begin exploring and interacting with the React Assessment project. The project includes the following features:

- A home page with some dummy content.
- Navigation bar with links to different sections.
- Placeholder components that can be extended and customized.
- Basic routing setup using React Router.

Feel free to modify and enhance the project to demonstrate your skills and understanding of React.

## Project Structure

The structure of the project is as follows:

```
Ubiquiti-Proj/
  |- public/
  |- src/
    |- assets/
       |- fonts/
       |- images/
    |- components/
       |- DataVies/
       |- FilerPanel.jtsx
       |- Header.jtsx
       |- IconList.jtsx
       |- SearchBar.jtsx
    |- pages/
       |- Home.tsx
       |- NotFound.tsx
    |- Redux/
        |- features/
            |- data/
               |- Devices.ts
               |- UpdatedData.ts
            |- filterPanel/
               |- Panel.ts
            |- filters/
               |- Filter.ts
            |- search/
               |- Search/
            |-Store.ts

    |- App.js
    |- index.js
    |- ...
  |- ...
```

The `public` directory contains the index HTML file and any other static assets. The `src` directory contains the main application code, including components and the root `App.js` file.

## Areas to Improve

While assessing your skills, we will be looking for the following areas of improvement in the project:

- **Code Organization**: Ensure the code is well-structured and follows best practices for component organization, separation of concerns, and module imports.
- **Styling**: Enhance the visual appeal of the application by improving the styling, using CSS frameworks, or implementing custom styles.
- **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling and validation where applicable, providing clear and user-friendly error messages.
- **Testing**: Add unit tests or integration tests to verify the functionality of the components and features.
- **Performance**: Optimize the performance of the application by identifying any bottlenecks or inefficiencies and implementing improvements.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure the application is accessible to users with disabilities by following accessibility guidelines and best practices.
- **Documentation**: Add relevant comments, inline documentation, or JSDoc annotations to explain complex code blocks or functions.

These are just a few suggestions, and you are encouraged to go beyond these areas and impress us with your skills and creativity!
